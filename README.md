# From Beirut To Minneapolis
## A protest guide in solidarity

_In solidarity with protesters in Minneapolis and other American cities, Lebanese technologists, 
protesters, and activists put together this document as a guide for escalating protests and documenting police abuse. 
We recognize that our experiences and lived realities are different, but in the same way that we’ve found solidarity 
with Hong Kong and Chile protesters, we wanted to extend ours to others._


## Protest safety, tear gas, and other hacks

_Protests can be an overwhelming experience when you are alone, so make sure – when possible – 
to go with a friend or with a small group. You are safer when you stay together._

_Tear gas contains several compounds that, when in contact with air or moisture, irritate 
the mucous membrane of the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs. This causes your eyes to tear up, your nose to run, 
and makes it difficult to breathe. Tear gas exposure can cause confusion, panic, anger, and other psychological effects, 
therefore try to remain calm. Panic is contagious._

### What to keep in your bag
- A bandana or mask cloth and a small bottle of cider vinegar (keep in mind that this should help 
you for the short period of time you would need to get upwind or reach higher grounds)
- Tight-fitting swim goggles/tight ski goggles
- Keep cut onions with you to inhale if teargas gets on your face
- Soda: Drinking soda usually helps instead of water because it’s acidic. You can also wash your face with soda. 
- Try to keep a dry change of clothes inside a plastic bag in your bag- so you can change in case you get wet.
- Wear helmets (especially if you have a medical condition).
- Portable battery for your phone. 


### General tips
- Do not park your car/bike close to the protest site to prevent police from scanning your license plate 
or damaging your bike/car. If you can walk to the protest, do it. 
- If you forget to turn off your location settings, take meandering routes to confuse your phone’s location 
in case police are looking at phone location data. 
- Stay in pairs or in a small group of people so that they would notice in case you’re missing or get arrested.
- Write a lawyer’s phone number on your arm with a marker and YELL OUT YOUR NAME, in case you’re arrested.
- Decide on an exit strategy/meet up point with your group in case you get separated. 
- Don’t go back home alone, police/undercover police may be waiting for you. 
- Once you get out of the protest - hide anything that may show that you were actually attending a protest (flags/banners/wet 
clothing) 
- Once tear gas is deployed, get upwind or find higher ground and remember to breathe calmly. Drinking or 
washing your face with water after you get exposed to teargas will exacerbate the stinging symptoms, not alleviate them. 
Do not rub your face. If you are wearing contact lenses, remove them immediately.
- If attacked by riot police DO NOT RUN, try to cover yourself and move away calmly (if with a group try 
to form a circle and back away together).
- Wear normal shoes to protect your feet in case people started throwing bottles/rocks- do not wear sandals.
- If you are using a gas mask, make sure to change the filters every day.

### When you’re home
- Get out of all your clothes and wash them separately in cold water.
- Take a shower, making sure you let cold water wash over your eyes until the stinging is gone, soap and 
cold water should get rid of the chemicals from your skin. 

## In the event of a media blackout 
_What happens if you’re on the streets but there are no media outlets covering? 
With no mainstream media keeping the authorities in check and covering in real time, police and 
military are likely to take more brutal measures against protesters. Here are the best tips from 
Lebanese protesters involved in the October revolution._

### Going live on social media 
- Use the platform that will reach the most of your intended audience. 
In the US, Twitter use is more important than Facebook use, so make sure you weigh the trade-offs when 
you decide which platform you’re using when you go live. 
- Try to keep your phone down if riot police are heavily deployed to avoid them noticing you’re filming. 
The sounds will still be clear in your live coverage.
- If you’re live on Facebook, the video will be saved in case it is interrupted by arrest or by locking the phone.
- If you’re live on Instagram and get interrupted, the video won’t be saved to your story for 24 hours and you won’t have the option to save it to your phone. That’s why Facebook live is a better option.
- If you want to go live on Twitter from your phone, you will have to download Periscope. Keep in mind that Periscope’s video quality is less clear than Facebook’s. 

### Filming police abuse and arrests
- Charge your phone and keep a portable charger. Your phone is all you’ll need. 
Your camera can be cumbersome and heavy when you need to start running. Keep it at home. 
- Identify yourself and the time, date, and location. If your location services are off, 
film intersections or street corners to identify the location and newspapers or some other media with the date and time. 
- Don’t film alone, always have a buddy protecting your back when things get heated. 
When riot police come charging at you while you’re filming, your adrenaline will be too high for you to notice you 
need to get to safety. That’s why having a buddy doing lookout is necessary. 
- Make sure to film angles and if you can, conduct eye-witness interviews (make sure to ask for permission first). 
- When filming an arrest, ask clearly and loudly that the person being arrested yells out their name. 
- If you are documenting celebrations, destruction, burning, consider sending the video to someone who is away from the protest so they can blur and/or remove faces from the footage. In the USA there is a history of arrest weeks and months after the protest.
